# Angel Totem

##   This is a mod for minecraft designed to grant the player creative flight in survival mode.

Angel Totem adds one item, the Totem of Unfalling, which is designed to make building in survival easier by allowing the player to fly within a configurable radius of a their respawn bed. However, it is not designed to be used in any other way. If the player takes damage while using it, they will drop the totem, and probably fall to their death.
It's been designed for use in modpacks. (mostly because i am lazy) The mod doesn't have any dependencies other than Fabric API, but the totem doesn't (at least for now) have any way to obtain it without cheating, so you'll need to configure loot tables or a recipe yourself with datapacks, KubeJS, etc. 

good luck :)
