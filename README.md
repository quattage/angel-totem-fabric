# Angel Rings Fabric

##   This is a mod for minecraft designed to grant the player creative flight in survival mode.

The ring is designed to make building in survival easier by allowing the player to fly within a configurable radius of a Lodestone. However, it is not designed to be used in any other way. If the player takes damage while using it, they will drop the ring, and probably fall to their death.
It's been designed for use in modpacks. (mostly because i am lazy) The mod doesn't require KubeJS to use, but the ring doesn't (at least for now) have a recipe, so you gotta do that yourself. 

good luck :)
